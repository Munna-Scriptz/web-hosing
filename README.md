npm install
npm start

Style & Structure Ideas

Use CSS Modules (e.g., styles/App.module.css) for scoped component styling.

Or try Styled Components for modular, JS-powered design.

Structure components for reusability: like PlanCard for hosting plans, Navbar, and Footer.

Add interactivity or global state later using React hooks or Context API.


---

Future Enhancements

Improve UI with theme toggling (dark/light mode).

Build real content with props—e.g., plan names, prices, features.

Add routing with react-router-dom for multiple pages (e.g., Pricing, About).

Expand into full functionality: integrate sign-up forms, APIs, authentication.

Why This Matters

This React version gives your project a solid, maintainable foundation, making it:

Easier to scale with features like routing or dynamic content.

Cleaner to style with modular CSS or JS styles.

Project-ready when you're ready to snap in real backend data or interactivity.
